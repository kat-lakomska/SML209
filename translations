<h1>On one of the wild beaches</h1>

<p>The car stood in the rain
Radio stopped playing
I touched your knees
We did not count the stars
 
She liked to dance
So full of joy
Always chasing the wind
Constantly thirsty for life
She kept losing things all the time
She wanted nothing.
I didn't understand, when she told me:
"Today is the last time
let's dance like the time has all but died"
She told me....
 
We were supposed to last for eternity
On one of the wild beaches
I wanted, with all my strength
To stay there with you...
 
She liked to dance
So full of joy
Always chasing the wind
Constantly thirsty for life
She kept losing things all the time
She wanted nothing.
I didn't understand, when she told me:
"Today is the last time
let's dance like the time has all but died"
She told me....
