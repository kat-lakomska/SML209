<h1>Red beads</h1>

<p>Red beads, red as wine</p>
<p>Beads from field rowan and tears of a girl and big tears</p>
 
<p>He praised my coat and my beads from the city</p>
<p>And he said that he wanted to dance with me</p>
<p>His jeans and the whiteness of my blouse</p>
<p>Connected in tango soon, he had gel rubbed in his hair</p>
 
<p>Later he took me for a trip</p>
<p>And at this trip he crumpled my white blouse</p>
<p>Everybody envied me there</p>
<p>When I came back and when I was walking in a crumpled blouse</p>
 
<p>Red beads, red as wine</p>
<p>Beads from field rowan and tears of a girl and big tears</p>
 
<p>Yesterday he was at those dances too</p>
<p>and the gel in his hair was shining like a silvery moon</p>
<p>But he was dancing with Kryśka all the time</p>
<p>and he didn't look at me even once</p>
 
<p>I will dance with some other man when you will be with this Kryśka</p>
<p>And later why not, let him crumple my blouse</p>
<p>Na, na, na, na...</p>
