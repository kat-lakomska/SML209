<h1>On one of the wild beaches</h1>

<p>The car stood in the rain</p>
<p>Radio stopped playing</p>
<p>I touched your knees</p>
<p>We did not count the stars</p>
 
<p>She liked to dance</p>
<p>So full of joy</p>
<p>Always chasing the wind</p>
<p>Constantly thirsty for life</p>
<p>She kept losing things all the time</p>
<p>She wanted nothing.</p>
<p>I didn't understand, when she told me:</p>
<p>"Today is the last time</p>
<p>let's dance like the time has all but died"</p>
<p>She told me....</p>
 
<p>We were supposed to last for eternity</p>
<p>On one of the wild beaches</p>
<p>I wanted, with all my strength</p>
<p>To stay there with you...</p>
 
<p>She liked to dance</p>
<p>So full of joy</p>
<p>Always chasing the wind</p>
<p>Constantly thirsty for life</p>
<p>She kept losing things all the time</p>
<p>She wanted nothing.</p>
<p>I didn't understand, when she told me:</p>
<p>"Today is the last time</p>
<p>let's dance like the time has all but died"</p>
<p>She told me....</p>
